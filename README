I made this openGL project in Rust a while ago and then I got angry with
Rust and decided to rewrite it in C++.

I got bored of it around the time I was going to implement shadows and proper
light sources. You can pick it up and do whatever with it.

To build:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
cd ..
./build/src/holodeck

The last one is because it looks for resources at a relative path from the top level
of the repository.
